## Release Notes v2.22.12

### 🚀 New Features

*   **🛡️ Connection Watchdog System**
    *   **Automated Stall Detection**: A new background monitoring system ("Watchdog") now actively supervises network requests. If a connection silently hangs (stops sending data without throwing an error), the interface explicitly warns you with a "Stalled?" message in red.
    *   **Intelligent UI Feedback**: The "Stalled" warning automatically clears and switches to a "Resuming..." state as soon as network activity is detected again, preventing false alarms during active retries.
    
*   **🔌 Enhanced Network Controls**
    *   **Configurable Timeout**: You can now adjust the **Network Timeout** directly in the Settings API tab (default: 10 seconds). This controls how long the system waits for a server response before attempting an automatic retry.
    *   **"Restart" Button**: The "Restart Connection" button has been renamed to **"Restart"** and its logic improved to accurately resume processing from the exact note where it left off, preventing skipped cards or double-counts.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

*   **Fixed Timeout Defaults**: Resolved an issue where the system could fall back to a hardcoded 60-second timeout even if the configuration was missing. The fallback is now strictly synchronized to **10 seconds** across all modules.
*   **Queue Logic Fixes**: Fixed a bug where waiting/queued windows would incorrectly trigger the "Stalled" warning. The watchdog now correctly ignores tasks that haven't started running yet.
*   **Visual improvements**: The "Stalled" warning color now matches the "Restart" button color for better visual consistency.

### ⚙️ Configuration

*   **Expanded Prompt Library**: Added a new built-in prompt **"English Analysis and Translation (JSON)"**. This complex prompt demonstrates how to analyze English words (Lemma, IPA, Morphology) and translate them into multiple target languages (RU, DE, UA) simultaneously using JSON output mode.

## Release Notes v2.22.2

### 🚀 New Features

*   **⏸️ Smart Execution Queue & Pause Control**
    Significant overhaul of the batch processing engine to support managing multiple tasks and granular control:
    *   **Execution Queue**: You can now launch multiple batch operations sequentially. If a task is running, subsequent requests are automatically queued and will start processing as soon as the current one finishes.
    *   **Pause/Resume**: Added a manual **Pause** button to the progress dialog. Pausing a task cleanly stops execution (transactionally after the current note) and yields the execution slot to the next waiting task in the queue.
    *   **Window Title Updates**: The window title now dynamically reflects the queue position (e.g., `Queue: #1`) when waiting.

*   **🖥️ UI Refinements**
    *   **Deck Path Display**: Added a dedicated, read-only field showing the full deck path of the active note.
    *   **Copy Button**: Included a clickable "Copy" icon (page symbol) inside the deck field to instantly copy the full path to the clipboard.
    *   **Responsive Layout**: The progress window is now fully resizeable with a standardized default size.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

*   **Fixed Race Condition**: Resolved a potential race condition where resuming a paused task could conflict with another active task. The system now correctly re-queues resumed tasks.
*   **PyQt6 Compatibility**: Fixed an `AttributeError` related to icon loading on newer Anki versions using PyQt6.

## Release Notes v2.20.2

### 🚀 New Features

*   **🎲 Configurable Random Delay**
    Introduced advanced controls for batch processing:
    *   **Enable Random Delay**: A new toggle allows users to add a layer of jitter to batch pauses.
    *   **Min/Max Random Delay**: Users can now precisely configure the random duration range (in seconds). This helps disperse requests, preventing potential rate limits or synchronization issues during high-volume processing.

### ⚙️ Improvements

*   **⚡ Better Default Batch Settings**
    Updated the default "Batch Processing" configuration to provide a smoother, more efficient experience for most users:
    *   **Batch Size**: 20 notes.
    *   **Fixed Delay**: 5 seconds.
    *   **Random Variance**: 0–10 seconds (enabled by default).

## Release Notes v2.18.12

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

*   **Fixed Crash in "Prompts" Submenu**
    Resolved a `NameError` that caused the addon to crash when attempting to run a prompt solely from the "Prompts" submenu context. The missing underlying helper functions have been restored, ensuring reliable launching of prompts from all menu locations (Favorites/History and the nested Submenu).

## Release Notes v2.18.10

### ⚙️ Improvements

*   **🔓 Readable Encrypted Backups**
    Refined the logic for password-protected backups. When creating an encrypted archive:
    *   The add-on now **automatically de-obfuscates** your credentials (e.g., API keys) *before* adding them to the archive.
    *   **Security**: Since the ZIP file itself is protected by your chosen password (AES-256), your sensitive data remains secure during transport.
    *   **Portability**: This ensures that once extracted, the `config.json` is human-readable and contains valid keys, allowing for easier manual restoration or migration to a new machine without fighting against internal masking mechanisms.

## Release Notes v2.18.8

#### **🛡️ Enhanced Backup System**
This release introduces a significant upgrade to the automated backup engine, ensuring your data is even safer:
*   **Recursive User Files Backup:** The backup system now recursively scans the entire `user_files` directory. This means any nested folders, assets, or sub-directories you create within your user files are now fully preserved in backups.
*   **Smart Exclusions:**
    *   **Loop Prevention:** The system intelligently identifies if your backup folder is located *inside* the `user_files` directory and excludes it from the backup process to prevent recursive "backing up of backups."
    *   **Cleaner Archives:** File exclusion logic has been refined to keep backup archives clean of system files like `signatures.json`.
*   **Robust Zip Creation:** The archive generation process has been rewritten to support these recursive structures while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.

#### **⚙️ Configuration & Content**
*   **Expanded Defaults:** The default configuration (`config.json`) has been significantly expanded, likely introducing a robust set of default prompts, presets, or examples to help new users get started immediately.

#### **🧹 Maintenance & Cleanup**
*   **Documentation Refinement:** Removed obsolete developer documentation (`DEVELOPER_README.md`) and consolidated project information into the main [README.md](file:///u:/voothi/20251206123938-intellifiller-ai-addon-for-anki/README.md).
*   **Asset Cleanup:** Removed unused static image assets (`editor-button.png`, `installation.png`, etc.) to reduce the overall package size.
*   **License Update:** Updated the `LICENSE` file.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/voothi/20251206123938-intellifiller-ai-addon-for-anki/compare/v2.16.2...v2.18.8

## Release Notes v2.16.2

#### **🚀 Enhancements & Refinements**

*   **Smart Batch Processing with Countdown:**
    *   Added a visual countdown timer to the progress dialog during batch processing pauses. Users can now see exactly how many seconds remain before the next batch begins.
    *   **Live Browser Refresh:** The Anki Browser list now automatically refreshes during these batch pauses, allowing users to verify generated content incrementally without waiting for the entire queue to finish.

*   **Improved Error Management:**
    *   **Reduced Error Noise:** Implemented a new error suppression logic. The native Anki error dialog will now appear **only once** for the first error encountered during a batch operation. Subsequent errors (e.g., network timeouts) are handled silently or skipped, preventing the user from being flooded with pop-ups and allowing the rest of the batch to proceed smoothly.

*   **Robust Cancellation & UI Logic:**
    *   **Graceful Dialog Closing:** Overhauled the Progress Dialog's closing behavior. Pressing **Esc** or clicking the **'X'** button now properly triggers the cancellation routine—stopping the worker thread and executing cleanup—rather than just hiding the window.
    *   **Guaranteed State Reset:** Improved cleanup logic to ensure the Anki Browser is always reset (reloading the note list) upon cancellation, preventing any "stuck" UI states or partial updates from being hidden.

*   **Network Resilience for Batching:**
    *   Refined the retry logic for network-related errors (timeouts, connection issues) within the worker thread to better cooperate with the new cancellation and error damping features.

## Release Notes v2.14.12

### 🎨 User Interface Improvements
*   **Prompts Tab Overhaul**: The **Prompts** tab in the Settings window has been completely redesigned to match the *Master-Detail* layout of the Pipelines tab.
    *   **Unified Design**: A list of prompts is now displayed on the left, with editable details on the right.
    *   **Improved Management**: Adding, removing, and editing prompts is now much faster and easier, especially for users with many saved prompts.
*   **Standardized Settings Dialog**: The Settings window now features standard **OK**, **Cancel**, and **Save** (Apply) buttons, aligning with native OS dialog behaviors.

### ⚡ Usability Enhancements
*   **Smart Change Detection**: The Settings window now intelligently tracks your edits.
    *   If you close the window (via `Esc` or 'X') without making changes, it closes immediately.
    *   The "Unsaved Changes" warning now **only** appears if you have actually modified a setting.
*   **Reduced Error Noise**: Fixed an issue where connection errors during batch processing would flood the screen with popups. The system now limits error reporting to a single notification per batch operation.

### 🛡️ Security & Build
*   **Packaging Upgrades**: Enhanced the build scripts to strictly enforce the exclusion of sensitive development files (such as `meta.json` or local `credentials.json`) from the final `.ankiaddon` package.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/voothi/20251206123938-intellifiller-ai-addon-for-anki/compare/v2.14.8...v2.14.12

## Release Notes v2.14.8

### 🚀 Key Improvements

#### 🛠️ Robust Windows Updates (Atomic Rename)
We have completely rewritten the update mechanism for Windows users to prevent the dreaded `PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied`. 
- **The Fix:** Instead of trying to delete locked files (like `.pyd` dependencies) during an update, the addon now "atomically renames" the old version to a temporary trash folder and "neutralizes" it.
- **Auto-Cleanup:** These trash folders are automatically cleaned up silently the next time you start Anki.
- **No More Errors:** This ensures future updates proceed smoothly without requiring you to manually disable the addon or restart Anki beforehand.

#### 📦 New Packaging Tools (For Developers)
Added a specialized packaging utility to safe-guard releases:
- `scripts/package_addon.py`: Creates clean `.ankiaddon` builds.
- Automatically excludes sensitive user data (`user_files`, `credentials.json`, `settings.json`) and development artifacts (`__pycache__`).
- Includes warnings if potentially sensitive files are detected in `vendor`.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Startup Crash:** Resolved a `NameError: name 'Path' is not defined` that could occur on initialization.
- **Fixed "Add-on Startup Failed"**: Corrected an issue where Anki attempted to load "trash" folders from previous updates. We now immediately remove `__init__.py` and `manifest.json` from the old folder during the rename process, so Anki correctly ignores it.

*   **🛠️ Granular Model Configuration**
    Users can now specify distinct model names for every provider (**OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, **Gemini**, **OpenRouter**, **Custom**) independently within the settings.

*   **⚡ Multi-Field Updates**
    Introduced a **JSON response format** option for prompts. This allows a single AI response to update multiple Anki fields simultaneously based on a configurable field mapping.

### 🔒 Security & UI

*   **🛡️ Security & Obfuscation**
    Added a toggle to **obfuscate sensitive credentials** in `credentials.json` along with support for a custom encryption key, preventing API keys from being stored in plain text.

## Release Notes v2.6.2

### 🏗 Architecture & Core Logic
*   **Pipeline Architecture**: Introduced a new **Pipelines** concept in the configuration schema. This logic allows users to define complex workflows (chains of prompts) rather than just single prompt executions.
*   **History Management**: Implemented a state tracking system (`History Management`) to keep logs of processed notes, likely preventing redundant generations or allowing rollbacks.
*   **Concurrency Model**: Added threaded processing logic for **multi-note operations**. The backend now handles batch requests asynchronously to prevent the Anki UI from freezing during large tasks.

### 💻 UI Components
*   **Progress Dialog**: Implemented a dedicated `ProgressDialog` class that visualizes the status of batch operations (e.g., "Processing 5/20 notes") with cancellation support.
*   **Context Menu Integration**: Added event handlers to inject "Generate" options into both the **Browser** context menu (for batch selections) and the **Editor** toolbar (for single notes).

### ⚙️ Configuration
*   **Schema Validation**: Enhanced the settings backend to strictly validate the new "Pipeline" structures and API configurations before saving.

**Full Changelog**: [v2.4.12...v2.6.2](https://github.com/voothi/20251206123938-intellifiller-ai-addon-for-anki/compare/v2.4.12...v2.6.2)

[Return to Top](#intellifiller-release-notes)

## Release Notes v2.4.12
