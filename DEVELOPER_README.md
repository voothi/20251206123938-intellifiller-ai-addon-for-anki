# IntelliFiller

## Development Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `python3.9 scripts/setup_vendor.py` to install dependencies for your platform
   - For M1/M2 Mac users: Make sure you're running Python for ARM64
   - For Windows/Intel Mac users: The script will automatically handle your architecture

## Creating a Release
1. Run `python scripts/build_release.py` to build dependencies for all platforms
2. This will create platform-specific directories in the vendor folder:
   - darwin_arm64 (M1/M2 Macs)
   - darwin_x86_64 (Intel Macs)
   - win32 (Windows)
   - linux (Linux)
3. The add-on is now ready to be packaged and uploaded to AnkiWeb

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter architecture-related errors during development:
- M1/M2 Mac users: Ensure you're using the ARM64 version of Python and pip
- Intel Mac users: Use the x86_64 version of Python and pip

## Known conflicts
- the extension can conflict with HyperTTS because of  typing_extensions.py . Disable HyperTTS if you see typing_extensions.py error
- **Windows Update Error:** When updating the addon on Windows, you may encounter `PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied`. This is because Anki locks the `.pyd` binary files used by the addon.
  - **Solution:** Close Anki -> Manually delete the addon folder `addons21/1149226090` -> Restart Anki -> Install new version.
